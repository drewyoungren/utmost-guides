            <title>Common PreTeXt Features</title>

            <introduction><p>There are some basic capabilities of the PreTeXt authored textbooks that facilitate their integration in a structured way into the design of a course and in the everyday teaching of a class.

            <subsection xml:id="subsection-linking">
            <title>Judicious Linking</title>
            <p>The defining feature of hypertext and, perhaps, the web in general is the ability to link from one resource to another. The structure of PreTeXt is ripe for such linking, both internally, as you regularly see with exercises citing theorems and sections referencing previous sections, and externally, as you would do if you were creating a document for your personal use. 
            </p><p>Instructors are encouraged to link to relevant parts of the text throughout their course materials (e.g., syllabi, lecture notes, assignments) and also in their feedback to students and on discussion boards in their Learning Management Systems (LMSs). Linking is often as simple as sharing the relevant URL to the particular resource. You can identify the URLs of specific parts of the textbooks in several ways:
 
            </p>

            <paragraphs>
            <title>Table of Contents</title>
            <sidebyside widths="65% 35%">

                <p>Instructors can add a link to any section or subsection in the textbook by simply right-clicking on the section in the table of contents and selecting "Copy Link Location" (or similar).</p>

                <figure xml:id="figure-section-url"><image source="images/section-URL.png" width="50%"><description>Screenshot for copying url from table of contents.</description></image>
                <caption>Copying URL for a subsection.</caption>

            <title>Index</title>
                <sidebyside widths="48% 48%">
                <p>Instructors can add direct links to more specific items (technically any division with an @xml:id tag). An easy way to find the relevant link is to locate the item in the index of each textbook. Clicking the item in the index will open a small box (a "knowl") and display the definition of the item. Each box contains an "In Context" link in the lower right. Instructors can right-click this link to copy the URL.</p>

            <title>Others</title>
                <p>Many divisions in a PreTeXt textbook are decorated with a faint paragraph sign ¶ (known as a "pilcrow"). These pilcrows represent links which center the browser at that division. Once clicked, the URL displayed in the browser's address bar can be copied and used in other documents. </p>

            <title>Sage Advice</title>

            <p><url href="https://www.sagemath.org/">Sage</url> is an open source language for doing mathematics. It is designed to replicate the functionality of popular computer algebra systems (<em>Mathematica</em>, MAPLE, etc.) in a unified, open source environment. It is free and may be downloaded and run locally on a user's personal computer. Many PreTeXt authors deploy what are known as Sage Cells like those seen above. These are one-off computing environments in which snippets of code can be executed and displayed in a browser without need for any installation of software on the user's part. The code can be altered in any way the user sees fit, and the original content can be restored by reloading the page.</p>  

            <p>Seriously, these things are great.</p>

You need a login to use the UTMOST hosted version of the HTML textbook. Please make sure that you have your login credentials and that you and your students do all of your work logged in to the textbook. If you or your students open the textbook in another device, you will need to enter your credentials. You will see a small key on the right upper corner that indicates you have logged in.</p>

                        <p>Each chapter of the HTML format of the textbook includes Reading Questions. Users of the PDF format of the textbook receive a PDF document with all the reading questions for each chapter of the textbook. These questions are included to encourage reading the textbook before class, as part of the preparation work. The UTMOST HTML format allows students to submit answers to these questions directly in the HTML version and have these responses saved and recorded. Once the students hit "submit answers", the instructor can immediately see the responses when logged in to their instructor account. The instructor version of the HTML textbook will show all the responses from the students who responded, each response labeled by the student ID, time, and date. Instructors might need to incentivize the completion of the reading questions by giving credit to students who complete them before class by certain time. The instructor can read the responses ahead of class and use them to tweak their plans for the day as needed. Some instructors show anonymized answers to address problems or to illustrate what an exemplary response looks like.</p>

We also ask instructors to read the responses before class and see whether changes are needed. When students are logged in to the HTML version of the text and respond to either Preview Activity questions or Reading Questions. Instructors are encouraged to use these questions with their students as well, in a similar fashion. Some instructors have used their Learning Management System to house the questions and keep track of student responses using a forum-like list, that presents all the responses without showing them to the students (or keeping them hidden until the student has submitted their own response).</p>

                    <p>The HTML format of the textbook takes advantage of the Sage programming language. Get acquainted with <url href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/sets-sage.html">how this textbook uses Sage</url> to learn more about it. Instructors can either assign this section to the students, or spend some time in class to illustrate how Sage works. The cells will take Python commands.</p>
                    <p> Each section of the HTML format of textbook contains Sage Exercises; they vary in complexity. The goal of these exercises is to get users to use technology to explore structures and make conjectures that would be very difficult to do by hand computation.</p>
                    <p> For example, the <url href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/cyclic-sage-exercises.html">Sage Exercises in Cyclic Groups</url> were written to help readers explore the cyclic patterns of the group of units mod <m>n</m>, <m>U(n)</m>, which is sometimes cyclic, sometimes not. By using Sage, users can easily test whether or not the <m>U(n)</m> is cyclic for large values of <m>n</m> and then make a conjecture about what the general case should be.</p>
                    <p>Sage can be used by typing a command line in a terminal window, in a Sage worksheet, and in the Jupyter notebook; however, the most friendly way to learn Sage is to use the Sage cell server.  The Sage cell server allows Sage to be embedded in any web page.  Users can modify and execute the Sage code.  If the edited code results in disaster, one only needs to reload the web page to restore the original code.  See the <url href="http://utmost-sage-cell.org">Sage Cell Repository</url> for more information.</p>

        An average section of the text is designed to be completed in about 2 hours of class meeting time. Each section begins with a Preview Activity that is intended for students to complete prior to class. Each is meant to be an accessible introduction to new ideas that rely largely on knowledge that students already have. Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15-20 minutes. If students are logged in to the HTML version of the text, the Preview Activities can be completed in the HTML version and the responses reviewed by the instructor.  Instructors can incentivize the completion of the Preview Activities by asking the students to put their work on their desks for review in class.

        Each section of the HTML format of the textbook includes Reading Questions (just prior to the Summary). Users of the PDF format of the textbook receive a PDF document with all the reading questions of the textbook. These questions are included to encourage reading the textbook either ahead of class. The UTMOST HTML format of the textbook allows students to submit answers to these questions directly in the HTML version and have these responses saved and recorded. Once the students hit "submit answers", the instructor can immediately see the responses when logged in to their instructor account. The instructor version of the HTML textbook will show all the responses from the students who responded, each response labeled by the student ID, time, and date. Instructors might need to incentivize the completion of the reading questions by giving credit to students who complete them before class by certain time. The instructor can read the responses ahead of class and use them to tweak their plans for the day as needed. Some instructors show anonymized answers to address problems or to illustrate what an exemplary response looks like.

  <paragraphs><title>WeBWorK</title>
      <p>
        Almost every Exercises section of the UTMOST HTML format of the textbook includes anonymous WeBWorK exercises that students can complete and receive immediate feedback with unlimited attempts without penalty ("anonymous" here means students' work is not recorded anywhere). The WeBWorK exercises are intended to be more routine than the following non-WeBWorK exercises.

  <!-- <paragraphs>
  <title>Exercises</title>
      <p>
        All Exercises sections include non-WeBWorK problems that are more complex as they seek to connect multiple ideas, challenge students, and encourage them to write.

    <paragraphs>
    <title>Solutions</title>
      <p>
        This textbook includes an instructor's solution manual with answers and solutions to each Activity and non-WeBWorK exercise in the text. The answers are available in the publicly posted electronic versions (both HTML and PDF).  The solutions manual is only available to instructors by direct request by email to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu).

            <title>Topic Order</title>
            <p>
            It is not recommended to change the order of the sections in the textbook because each chapter builds upon what has been done before.

        <paragraphs>
        <title>Audience
        </title>
        <p>Proofs and proof-writing play a large role in this text as the original audience was mathematics majors. However, some instructors have chosen to deemphasize these aspects for students who may not require such rigor. It is recommended that instructors be up front with their students about expectations regarding these aspects. Similar care should be taken with some more advanced computational concepts. </p>

        <paragraphs>
        <title>Acronyms</title>
            <p>
            This textbook does not use numbering system for the sections as other textbooks. The author uses acronyms to refer to each section, as they encode information about that content, that is more useful than “Theorem 5.1 is.” The best way to handle them is to use them in class continuously. Students do not have to memorize them. It is sufficient  that they can recall what theorem they may need to use. Every chapter has annotated acronyms for definitions and theorems that remind readers the importance of each of them. Although students get anxious about the many acronyms, it is not such a big deal.
            </p>

            <p>
                Of great help to both instructors and students is the <url href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/reference.html">Reference</url> chapter. It is organized by the major sections of the textbook. Each section contains all the symbols and terminology used in that section, with a knowl that provides its definition and an "in context" link. Each of these sections is searchable.

            The textbook works with examples called <url href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-A.html">Archetypes</url>, labeled with a letter, and ordered alphabetically. The Archetypes provide a range of examples that fit specific properties. They are included to serve as illustrations for how properties work or fail. They can be used to test conjectures. The students can be encouraged to check them whenever they are learning new material. The archetypes include the relevant theorems.

            <title>Sage</title>
            <p>
            The textbook makes heavy use of Sage cells (there are 96 vignettes with Sage cells, a list of which can be found here <url href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-SL.html">Sage</url>). These are intended to help students learn to use Sage to do linear algebra and to learn how to do linear algebra by using computational examples. There is a separate <url href="https://github.com/rbeezer/sla">GitHub repository</url> that contains 17 Sage worksheets that instructors can use in class (in several output formats, including Jupyter, PDF, etc.).  They are "incomplete" and meant to be filled in during class. For some examples, a random elements are generated; in others, a carefully constructed example is explicitly defined. There is a <url href="https://github.com/rbeezer/sla/blob/master/worksheets/overview.pdf">master document</url> with a short description and expected duration (usually between 5 and 20 minutes) for each. Instructors can do them in class. they can see many different examples in class.</p> 
            <!-- <p>((((NEEDS EDITING In exams, the students can be asked to analyze 7x7 matrices; in a website they can cut and paste (reduce echelon form, factor,... eigenvalues.,,, determinant). the instructions in the exam indicates what operations they can use; they can use Sage to check their work. Students need to learn really well the syntax for entering the command during the exam.))))

            <introduction>
            <p>This guide is intended for instructors at test sites participating in the UTMOST project (hence the use of second person). It will not be relevant to general textbook users as these features have been activated only for the UTMOST participants. </p>

            <title>Textbook Formats and Versions</title>

            <p>Being open-source textbooks, there may be several (maybe dozens) of implementations of your textbook on the open web. It is <em>very important</em> you and your students use the UTMOST-specified version of the text.</p>

            <p>Different sites have been designated to use either the HTML (online) format of the textbook or the PDF (offline or printed) format.

                <title>Highlighting</title>
                
                <p>The HTML format of the textbooks allow students to highlight portions of the text and have those persist across different platforms. Instructors' versions makes this available as well, though when text is highlighted, they are given the choice to highlight or simply copy the text to the clipboard.</p>

            <subsection xml:id="subsection-reading-questions">
            <title>Reading Questions</title>
            
            <p>As you cover material in various parts of the book, it is important you assign the Reading Questions for the relevant sections. The authors have written them as a quick check on readers' comprehension after first exncountering the material of a section. These can be of great help to the researchers, the instructor, and, indeed, the students themselves.It is at the instructor's discretion exactly when and how to assign these, but it is highly recommended that instructors provide incentives (e.g., extra credit for completing a certain number before a certain time) for students to complete them. There are small differences in how they can be implemented depending on what format of the textbook you are using.  </p>

            <paragraphs>
            <title>HTML Format</title>
            <p>The HTML format of textbooks allows students to answer the reading questions directly through their browsers. Students can change their responses before they submit them; each section has a tutorial on how to write math that it is straightforward to use. Once the students submit their answers, instructors can see them in their textbook. A quick scan of the responses can inform the instructor if some material requires further attention. Researchers will receive and analyze anonymized copies of student responses. You will be able to track who has responded and use that information for assigning extra credit if you chose to do that.</p>
            </paragraphs>

            <paragraphs>
        <title>PDF Format</title>
            <p> The PDF format of the textbooks don’t have Reading Questions. They  are distributed separately to instructors (in the participating instructors’ directions). We suggest that you set up a system, perhaps with your Learning Management System platform, so that students can input their responses there. Many systems (e.g., Canvas) have a "Discussions" tool in which the Reading Questions can be posted as prompts that students use to reply to. The system can be set up so that students’ can’t see their peer responses unless they have provided their own. </p>
