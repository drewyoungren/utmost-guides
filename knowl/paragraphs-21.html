<p>The PDF format of the textbooks don’t have Reading Questions. They  are distributed separately to instructors (in the participating instructors’ directions). We suggest that you set up a system, perhaps with your Learning Management System platform, so that students can input their responses there. Many systems (e.g., Canvas) have a "Discussions" tool in which the Reading Questions can be posted as prompts that students use to reply to. The system can be set up so that students can’t see their peers' responses unless they have provided their own.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-utmost-specifics.html#paragraphs-21">in-context</a></span>
