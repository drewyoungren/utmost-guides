<p>As you cover material in various parts of the book, it is important you assign the Reading Questions for the relevant sections. The authors have written them as a quick check on readers' comprehension after first encountering the material of a section. These can be of great help to the researchers, the instructor, and, indeed, the students themselves. It is at the instructor's discretion exactly when and how to assign these, but it is highly recommended that instructors provide incentives (e.g., extra credit for completing a certain number before a certain time) for students to complete them. There are small differences in how they can be implemented, depending on what format of the textbook you are using.</p>
