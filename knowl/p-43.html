<p>These are lecture notes that the instructors write down on paper; some instructors include full text they want to write on the board as they present or that they want to make sure to say. Some instructors only write a bulleted outline to make sure that they state what they need in each lesson. These notes may include fully solved examples from the textbook or from other sources. In all cases the authors keep the same nomenclature and notation as the one used in the textbook. These notes may or may not be shared with the students. Some instructors have built in class time for students to work on some of the examples from their lecture notes. Students may work individually for a while, then share their work with their neighbors, and then with the class. As students work, some instructors wait at the front of the room, others circulate and answer questions. Instructors may demonstrate the solution and have students comment by comparing the instructor's solution to theirs.</p>
