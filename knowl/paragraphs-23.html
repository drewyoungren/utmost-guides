<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Online videos.</span></h5>
<p>These are screen cast videos that instructors prepare with the intention to highlight points from the textbook. The video may show the instructor reading the textbook, highlighting words that need to be clarified, or explaining a definition or a theorem. The instructor may use an alternative example, include a different proof, or demonstrate a technique that is not in the textbook. These videos are distributed to the students via their syllabus or their Learning Management System; the expectation is for students to view and study the videos prior to attending class, and perhaps send some comments or answer some questions ahead of time. Class time is spent on answering questions students may have about the information on the textbook or on the video and in solving more complex problems related to the content of the section.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-use-cases-lecture-notes.html#paragraphs-23">in-context</a></span>
