<p>Over the various semesters of data collection, the UTMOST participating faculty has shared with us various strategies that they use to create their lecture notes. These strategies vary in terms of how much the lecture notes incorporate features of the textbooks, the medium that the instructors use to create them, and the way in which the instructors use them in the classroom. These are provided as illustrations for other UTMOST participants. The creation of the lecture notes can incorporate one or more of these strategies. Some instructors incorporate more than one textbook as they teach as well.</p>
