<article class="paragraphs"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Acronyms</span></h5>
<p>This textbook does not use numbering system for the sections as other textbooks. The author uses acronyms to refer to each section, as they encode information about that content, that is more useful than “Theorem 5.1 is.” The best way to handle them is to use them in class continuously. Students do not have to memorize them. It is sufficient  that they can recall what theorem they may need to use. Every chapter has annotated acronyms for definitions and theorems that remind readers the importance of each of them. Although students get anxious about the many acronyms, it is not such a big deal.</p>
<p>Of great help to both instructors and students is the <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/reference.html" target="_blank">Reference</a> chapter. It is organized by the major sections of the textbook. Each section contains all the symbols and terminology used in that section, with a knowl that provides its definition and an "in context" link. Each of these sections is searchable.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-textbook-specifics.html#paragraphs-13">in-context</a></span>
