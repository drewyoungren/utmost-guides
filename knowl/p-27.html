<p>This textbook does not use a numbering system for the sections as many other textbooks do. The author uses acronyms to refer to each section, as they encode information about that content; this is more useful than “Theorem 5.1 is...” The best way to handle them is to use them in class continuously. Students do not have to memorize them. It is sufficient  that they can recall what theorem they may need to use. Every chapter has Annotated Acronyms for definitions and theorems that remind readers of the importance of each of them. Although students get anxious about the many acronyms, it is not such a big deal.</p>
