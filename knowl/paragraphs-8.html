<p>Each section in the textbook has three Activities (e.g., <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/ac/sec-1-3-derivative-pt.html#Mtw" target="_blank">Activity 1.3.2</a>) that are designed for being done in class by students. There is a PDF Activities Workbook that can be printed so students can use it to work on in class.</p>
<p>Students using the HTML version of the textbook can revise the responses they provide to the Preview Activity questions before they submit them. Once they are submitted, the instructor can immediately see the responses when logged into their instructor account.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-textbook-specifics.html#paragraphs-8">in-context</a></span>
