<p>This guide is intended for faculty who have adopted a PreTeXt-authored open textbook for their class, particularly for those in the UTMOST study. It includes ideas for integrating common PreTeXt features into teaching practices as well as specific guides for users of particular textbooks. Authors make choices on what features to use and include in their textbooks. There are some features of PreTeXt that are common across the textbooks, the possibility of linking pages, sections, or individual content units, and the possibility to integrate Sage. There are other features that are specific to each of the textbooks that are used in the project. And there are features that have been added for testing in the UTMOST research study. Each of these is described in this document.</p>
