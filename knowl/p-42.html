<p>The HTML format of textbooks allows students to answer the reading questions directly through their browsers. Students can change their responses before they submit them; each section has a tutorial on how to write math that it is straightforward to use. Once the students submit their answers, instructors can see them in their textbook. A quick scan of the responses can inform the instructor if some material requires further attention. Researchers will receive and analyze anonymized copies of student responses. You will be able to track who has responded and use that information for assigning extra credit if you chose to do that.</p>
