<p>The defining feature of hypertext—and, perhaps, the web in general—is the ability to link from one resource to another. The structure of PreTeXt is ripe for such linking, both internally, as you regularly see with exercises citing theorems and sections referencing previous sections, and externally, as you would do if you were creating a document for your personal use.</p>
