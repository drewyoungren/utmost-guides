<p>These are slide presentations that instructors create ahead of time with the intention of projecting them on a screen during class. These provide the structure for the presentation, and release the instructor of writing text that may be time-consuming or prone to errors. The instructor may distribute these documents ahead of time to the students in electronic form via their Learning Management System or bring printed copies to class. Some of these lecture notes have blank space that can be filled in during the lecture with students' work or with instructor's commentaries. These can be distributed in PDF format and may include live links to specific sections of the textbook that might be shown during class as needed. Instructors may also project their printed copies of these slides using a document camera and write on them to generate a record of the class. Some instructors upload scans of the completed notes after class in their Learning Management System so that students can have a record of what was done in class.</p>
