<p><a class="external" href="https://www.sagemath.org/" target="_blank">Sage</a> is an open source language for doing mathematics. It is designed to replicate the functionality of popular computer algebra systems (<em class="emphasis">Mathematica</em>, MAPLE, etc.) in a unified, open source environment. It is free, and while it may be downloaded and run locally on a user's personal computer, many PreTeXt authors deploy what are known as Sage Cells which require nothing to be downloaded on the user's end. Examples can be seen below. These are one-off computing environments in which snippets of code can be executed and displayed in a browser without the need for any installation of software on the user's part. The code can be altered in any way the user sees fit, and the original content can be restored by reloading the page.</p>
