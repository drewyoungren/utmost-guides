<p>Each section of the HTML format of textbook contains Sage exercises.  These exercises vary in complexity. The goal of the exercises is to get users to use technology to explore structures and make conjectures that would be very difficult to explore by hand computation. For example, the <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/cyclic-sage-exercises.html" target="_blank">Sage Exercises in Cyclic Groups</a> were written to help readers explore the cyclic patterns of the group of units mod \(n\text{,}\) \(U(n)\text{,}\) which is sometimes cyclic, sometimes not. By using Sage, users can easily test whether or not the \(U(n)\) is cyclic for large values of \(n\) and then make a conjecture about what the general case should be.</p>
