<p>In addition to the Reading Questions, each section begins with a Preview Activity (see, for example, <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/ac/sec-5-3-substitution.html#fEx" target="_blank">5.3.1</a>) which is meant to be an accessible introduction to new ideas that rely largely on knowledge that students already have. Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15â€“20 minutes. If students are logged in to the HTML version of the text, the Preview Activities can be completed in the HTML version and the responses reviewed by the instructor.  Instructors can incentivize the completion of the Preview Activities by asking the students to put their work on their desks for review in class.</p>
