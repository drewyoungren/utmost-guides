<p>The textbook makes heavy use of Sage cells (there are 96 vignettes with Sage cells, a list of which can be found here <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-SL.html" target="_blank">Sage</a>). These are intended to help students learn to use Sage to do linear algebra and to learn how to do linear algebra by using computational examples. There is a separate <a class="url" href="https://github.com/rbeezer/sla" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> that contains 17 Sage worksheets that instructors can use in class (in several output formats, including Jupyter, PDF, etc.).  They are "incomplete" and meant to be filled in during class. For some examples, a random elements are generated; in others, a carefully constructed example is explicitly defined. There is a <a class="url" href="https://github.com/rbeezer/sla/blob/master/worksheets/overview.pdf" target="_blank">master document</a> with a short description and expected duration (usually between 5 and 20 minutes) for each. Instructors can do them in class. they can see many different examples in class.</p>
