</div></div></section><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-4"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Syllabus</span></h5>
<p id="p-14">Be selective in what you cover in your course. This includes the sections of the textbook as well as the Sage exercises. You can use the chapter diagram that is presented in the <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/preface-1.html" target="_blank">Preface</a> to make decisions about what to include or exclude.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-5"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Sage</span></h5>
<p id="p-15">The HTML format of the textbook takes advantage of the Sage programming language. To become acquainted with Sage, see <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/sets-sage.html" target="_blank">how this textbook uses Sage</a>.  Instructors can either assign this section to the students, or spend some time in class to illustrate how Sage works.</p>
<p id="p-16">Each section of the HTML format of textbook contains Sage exercises.  These exercises vary in complexity. The goal of the exercises is to get users to use technology to explore structures and make conjectures that would be very difficult to explore by hand computation. For example, the <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/cyclic-sage-exercises.html" target="_blank">Sage Exercises in Cyclic Groups</a> were written to help readers explore the cyclic patterns of the group of units mod \(n\text{,}\) \(U(n)\text{,}\) which is sometimes cyclic, sometimes not. By using Sage, users can easily test whether or not the \(U(n)\) is cyclic for large values of \(n\) and then make a conjecture about what the general case should be.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-reference"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Reference</span></h5>
<p id="p-17">This textbook includes a <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/aata/backmatter.html" target="_blank">Reference</a> section that includes appendices and the index. Of particular note is the Notation appendix which includes a list of symbolic notation and links to their occurrences in the text.</p></article></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-ac"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<div class="sbspanel" style="width:71.7948717948718%;justify-content:flex-start;"><p id="p-18">This page provides complementary information to the section <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/ac/preface-3.html" target="_blank">Features of the Text</a>.  In this section, we highlight four features of this textbook that users need to be aware of for course and lesson planning: the Preview Activities, the Class Activities, WeBWorK, and Solutions. </p></div>
</div></div></section><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-7"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Preview Activities</span></h5>
<p id="p-19">In addition to the Reading Questions, each section begins with a Preview Activity (see, for example, <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/ac/sec-5-3-substitution.html#fEx" target="_blank">5.3.1</a>) which is meant to be an accessible introduction to new ideas that rely largely on knowledge that students already have. Most Preview Activities can be completed in 15–20 minutes. If students are logged in to the HTML version of the text, the Preview Activities can be completed in the HTML version and the responses reviewed by the instructor.  Instructors can incentivize the completion of the Preview Activities by asking the students to put their work on their desks for review in class.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-8"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Class Activities</span></h5>
<p id="p-20">Each section in the textbook has three Activities (e.g., <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/ac/sec-1-3-derivative-pt.html#Mtw" target="_blank">Activity 1.3.2</a>) that are designed for being done in class by students. There is a PDF Activities Workbook that can be printed so students can use it to work on in class.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-9"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">WeBWorK</span></h5>
<p id="p-21">Almost every Exercises section of the HTML format of the textbook includes anonymous WeBWorK exercises that students can complete and receive immediate feedback on—with unlimited attempts and without penalty ("anonymous" here means students' work is not recorded anywhere). The WeBWorK exercises are intended to be more routine than the following non-WeBWorK exercises.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-10"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Solutions</span></h5>
<p id="p-22">This textbook includes an instructor's solution manual with answers and solutions to each Activity and non-WeBWorK exercise in the text. The answers are available in the publicly posted electronic versions (both HTML and PDF).  The solutions manual is only available to instructors by direct request by email to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu).</p></article></section><section class="subsection" id="subsection-fcla"><h3 class="heading hide-type">

<a href="section-textbook-specifics.html#subsection-fcla" class="permalink">¶</a><section class="introduction" id="introduction-6"><div class="sidebyside"><div class="sbsrow" style="margin-left:1.25%;margin-right:1.25%;">
<div class="sbspanel" style="width:25.6410256410256%;justify-content:flex-start;"><img width="100%" src="images/cover-fcla.png" alt="FCLA cover."></div>
<div class="sbspanel" style="width:71.7948717948718%;justify-content:flex-start;"><p id="p-23">This page provides complementary information to the section "How to Use this Book" in the Preface of the textbook. </p></div>
</div></div></section><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-11"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Topic Order</span></h5>
<p id="p-24">It is not recommended to change the order of the sections in the textbook because each chapter builds upon what has been done before.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-12"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Audience</span></h5>
<p id="p-25">Proofs and proof-writing play a large role in this text because the original audience was mathematics majors. However, some instructors have chosen to deemphasize these aspects for students who may not require such rigor. It is recommended that instructors be up front with their students about expectations regarding these aspects. Similar care should be taken with some more advanced computational concepts.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-13"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Acronyms</span></h5>
<p id="p-26">This textbook does not use a numbering system for the sections as many other textbooks do. The author uses acronyms to refer to each section, as they encode information about that content; this is more useful than “Theorem 5.1 is...” The best way to handle them is to use them in class continuously. Students do not have to memorize them. It is sufficient  that they can recall what theorem they may need to use. Every chapter has Annotated Acronyms for definitions and theorems that remind readers of the importance of each of them. Although students get anxious about the many acronyms, it is not such a big deal.</p>
<p id="p-27">Of great help to both instructors and students is the <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/reference.html" target="_blank">Reference</a> chapter. It is organized by the major sections of the textbook. Each section contains all the symbols and terminology used in that section, with a knowl that provides its definition and an "in context" link. Each of these sections is searchable.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-14"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Exercises</span></h5>
<p id="p-28">This textbook has three categories of exercises: computational (labeled as C), conceptual (labeled as M), and theoretical (labeled as T). The author has a particular numbering system that does not mean much. It allows adding and changing problems as needed.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-15"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Proof Techniques</span></h5>
<p id="p-29">The textbook contains a chapter on <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-PT.html" target="_blank">Proof Techniques</a> that has been included to support students as they build their proving skills. Instructors can remind the students of the techniques that are available and explained in this chapter.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-16"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Archetypes</span></h5>
<p id="p-30">The textbook works with examples called <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-A.html" target="_blank">Archetypes</a>; they are labeled with a letter and ordered alphabetically. The Archetypes provide a range of examples that fit specific properties. They are included to serve as illustrations for how properties work or fail. They can be used to test conjectures. The students can be encouraged to check them whenever they are learning new material. The Archetypes include the relevant theorems.</p></article><article class="paragraphs" id="paragraphs-17"><h5 class="heading"><span class="title">Sage</span></h5>
<p id="p-31">The textbook makes heavy use of Sage cells (there are 96 vignettes with Sage cells, a list of which can be found in the  <a class="url" href="https://books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-SL.html" target="_blank">Sage appendix</a><a knowl="" class="id-ref" refid="hk-fn-2" id="fn-2"><sup> 1 </sup></a><span id="hk-fn-2" class="hidden-content tex2jax_ignore"><span class="footnote"><code class="code-inline tex2jax_ignore">books.aimath.org/fcla/appendix-SL.html</code></span></span>). These are intended to help students learn to use Sage to do linear algebra and to learn how to do linear algebra by using computational examples. There is a separate <a class="url" href="https://github.com/rbeezer/sla" target="_blank">GitHub repository</a> that contains 17 Sage worksheets that instructors can use in class (in several output formats, including Jupyter, PDF, etc.).  They are "incomplete" and are meant to be filled in during class. For some examples, random elements are generated; in others, a carefully constructed example is explicitly defined. There is a <a class="url" href="https://github.com/rbeezer/sla/blob/master/worksheets/overview.pdf" target="_blank">master document</a> with a short description and the expected duration (usually between 5 and 20 minutes) for each. Instructors can do them in class; they can see many different examples in class.</p></article></section></section></div></main>
